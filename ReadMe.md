# Technology Explorations / Demonstrations

![](pictures/2021-05-04_14-21-46-000‚ù§Ô∏è.jpg)

This project explores open technologies in IoT for wearables as part of research activities investigating wearable Internet of Things and the Self within the [Open Design of trusted Things - OpenDoTT](https://opendott.org.) project.

The content of this repository can also be found online under: https://github.com/opendott-wats/D2.1-Technology-Demonstrators

# Repository Contents

The repository contains code and documentation of two larger activities in exploring potentials and possiblities of open technology for sketching and protoyping for wearable IoT.
## Open Technology Training

Under `/training` directory you can find code snippets and sketches as well as external examples used in and/or written during the Open Technology Traning as far as captured and significantly extended.

## Explorations on making a wearable IoT piece

Extending the training explorations on building a working piece of wearable IoT were made.

- [Testing LoRaWAN connectivity and capability](explorations/LoRa/LoraSendAndReceive_TTN_OpenDoTT_Test)
- Making a Step Tracker
  - Steps to SDCard (a simple logger)
  - step tracker 2 (extensive work on this one)
  - seeed step counter testbed (to test the sensor)
- Sketches for new design probes
  - the listeing thing (but only boiler plate code, abandonned)
  - the sonic reminder (MIDI prof of function)
    - later continued as the MIDIThing with Circuit Python
- **/explorations/the-drawing-things** contains [p5js](https://p5js.org) skteches on creating "ink" from recorded step data
